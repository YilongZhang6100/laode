\begin{exercise} \label{YZ_3.4.2}
Suppose $A$ is a $3\times 3$ matrix with rank less than $3$. Determine how many solution the homogeneous system $Ax=0$ has and how many solutions the inhomogenous system $Ax=b$ has.


\begin{solution}
\ans
If $A$ has rank lower than $3$. $Ax=0$ has infinitely many solutions. $Ax=b$ can have infinitely many solutions or no solution depending on whether the system of equations is consistent or inconsistent.

\end{solution}
