Let ${\cal P}_n$ be the vector space of polynomials $p(t)$ of
degree less than or equal to $n$.  Show that $\{1,t,t^2,\ldots,t^n\}$ is a
basis for ${\cal P}_n$.

\begin{solution}
\soln
To show that the set $\{1,t,t^2,\dots,t^n\}$ is a basis for
${\cal P}_n$, we must show that the $n + 1$ polynomials are
linearly independent and span ${\cal P}_n$.  The polynomials are
independent because the general polynomial of degree $n$:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2t + \alpha_3t^2 + \cdots + \alpha_{n+1}t^n
\]
is identically $0$ for all values of $t$ only when $\alpha_1 =
\alpha_2 = \cdots = \alpha_{n + 1} = 0$.  The polynomials span
${\cal P}_n$ because every polynomial $p(t)$ of degree $n$ has
the form
\[ p(t) = \beta_1 + \beta_2t + \cdots + \beta_{n + 1}t^n \]
which is a linear combination of the polynomials
$\{1,t,t^2,\dots,t^n\}$ for any $p(t)$ in ${\cal P}_n$.
