Let $A$ be a nonzero $3\times 3$ matrix such that $A^2=0$.  Show that
$\rank(A)=1$.

\begin{solution}

\soln Since $A$ is a nonzero $3 \times 3$ matrix, $\rank(A)$ can only equal $1$,
$2$, $3$.  

If $\rank(A) = 3$, then $A$ is invertible, so there exists a matrix $B$ such that 
$AB = I_3$.  Then $A = A^2B = 0$.  So, nullity$(A) = 3$ and $\rank(A) = 0$, 
which contradicts the assumption that $\rank(A) = 3$.  Therefore, $\rank(A) =1$ or  $2$.

Let $\rank(A) = 2$ and let $w_1, w_2$ be a basis for range$(A)$.  It follows that 
nullity$(A) =1$.  Next choose $v_1,v_2$ such that $Av_1 = w_1$ and $Av_2 = w_2$. 
Note that $v_1,v_2$ are linearly independent because $w_1,w_2$ are linearly 
independent.  The assumption that $A^2=0$ implies that $Aw_1 = Aw_2 = 0$ and 
hence that nullity$(A) \geq 2$.  A contradiction.  Thus, $\rank(A) \neq 2$, so, by 
elimination $\rank(A) = 1$.
