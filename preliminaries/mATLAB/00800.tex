\begin{computerExercise}\label{YZ_1.2_operation3}
Use \Matlab to compute $\log(-0.1) $.  Are you surprised by the answer? 

\begin{solution}
\ans $\log(-0.1) = -2.3026 + 3.1416 i$.

\soln
The \Matlab response to log(-0.1) may be unexpected since the real logarithm is only defined for positive real numbers.  The \Matlab help for $\log$ states:

\begin{quote}
$\log(x)$ returns the natural logarithm $\ln(x)$.
The $\log$ functionâ€™s domain includes negative and complex numbers, which can lead to unexpected results if used unintentionally. For negative and complex numbers z = u + i*w, the complex logarithm log(z) returns
\[
\log(\text{abs}(z)) + \text{angle}(z)*i
\]
If you want negative and complex numbers to return error messages rather than return complex results, use {\tt reallog} instead of {\tt log}.
