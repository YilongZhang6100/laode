\begin{exercise} \label{c2.3.8}
(a) Consider the $2\times 2$ matrix
\begin{equation}  \label{e:2x2}
\mattwo{a}{b}{c}{1}
\end{equation}
where $a,b,c\in\R$ and $a\neq 0$.  Show that \eqref{e:2x2}
is row equivalent to the matrix
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \frac{b}{a} \\ 0 & \frac{a-bc}{a}
\end{array} \right).
\]
(b)  Show that \eqref{e:2x2} is row equivalent to the
identity matrix if and only if $a\neq bc$.

\begin{solution}

(a)
Two matrices are row equivalent if there is a sequence of row operations
that leads from one to the other.  In this case:
\begin{itemize}
\item Divide the $1^{st}$ row of \eqref{e:2x2} by $a$.

\item Subtract $c$ times the $1^{st}$ row from the $2^{nd}$ row.
\end{itemize}
The result is
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \frac{b}{a} \\ 0 & \frac{a - bc}{a}\end{array}
\right).
\]

(b) If $a \neq bc$, then we can row reduce \eqref{e:2x2} to $I_2$ by
performing the two row operations in part (a), followed by:

\begin{itemize}
\item Multiply the $2^{nd}$ row by the nonzero number $\frac{a}{a - bc}$.

\item  Subtract $\frac{b}{a}$ times the second row from the first row.
\end{itemize}

This gives the identity matrix $I_2$.

\para If $a = bc$, then $\frac{a - bc}{a} = 0$ and the matrix is row equivalent to
\[
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \frac{b}{a} \\ 0 & 0\end{array} \right),
\]
which has only one pivot and cannot be row reduced to $I_2$.
