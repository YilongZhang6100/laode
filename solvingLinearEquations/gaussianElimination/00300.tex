     \begin{exercise} \label{c2.3.7aa}
       Suppose that $\tilde{A} = [A|b]$ is the augmented matrix of a system of $4$ linear equations in $7$ unknowns. Suppose that the solution is defined by $5$ parameters. Let $E$ be the $4\times 8$ reduced echelon form of $\tilde{A}$. How many pivots does $E$ have?
\begin{solution}

\ans $2$ 

\soln       In general, the number of parameters is $n-p$ where $n$ is the number of unknowns and $p$ is the number of pivots.  Therefore, the number of pivots is $7$ minus the number of parameters $=7-5 = 2$.
